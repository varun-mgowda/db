<h3><span style="font-size: 26px;">Top 5 Cost Saving actions</span></h3>
<h4>1. Hang out the washing instead of tumble drying&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Hanging the washing out instead of using the tumble drier will <strong>save about 153kg CO<sub>2</sub> a year</strong>&nbsp;- that's <strong>£52 (USD68) each year</strong>, based on 150 cycles a year.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2. Turn down the heating by 1⁰C</h4>
<p>Reducing your heating by 1⁰C can <strong>reduce your energy consumption by 8%</strong>. For an average household gas bill of 12,500kWh this will <strong>r</strong><strong>educe your CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions by 184kg</strong>&nbsp;- that's <strong>£42 (USD55) each year</strong>.</p>
<h4>3.&nbsp;Only fill the kettle with the amount of water you need to boil</h4>
<p><strong></strong>Only boiling the amount of water for your hot drink will save <strong>72kg CO<sub>2</sub></strong> a year - that's <strong>£23</strong> (<strong>USD30) per annum</strong></p>

<h4>5.&nbsp;Turn electrical equipment off when not in use&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Fully turning off just one LCD TV (rather than leaving it on standby) for 18 hours a day will save about<strong> 5kg CO<sub>2</sub> a year&nbsp;</strong>- saving <strong>£2 a year (USD2.64)</strong>.<strong> </strong>Turn off all other electrical equipment when not in use to multiply the savings.</p>

<h3>Technology based energy savings</h3>
<p>
<a href="/energyconsumption.html"></a></p>
<p>The following is a list of items that may take an initial investment, but should pay for themselves through savings on your energy bills.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fit energy saving light bulbs&nbsp;- LEDs can save 90% of lighting energy costs</li>
    <li>Install thermostatic valves on your radiators</li>
    <li>Insulate your hot water tank</li>
    <li>Install cavity wall installation</li>
    <li>Install 180mm thick loft insulation</li>
    <li>Replace your old refrigerator / freezer (if it is over 15 years old), with a new one with energy efficiency rating of "A++"</li>
    <li>Replace your old boiler with a new energy efficient condensing boiler</li>
</ul>
<h3>Travel less and travel more carbon footprint friendly&nbsp;</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Car share to work or for the kids school run</li>
    <li>Use the bus or a train rather than your car</li>
